          A soulbound smart contract is a type of smart contract that is
          designed to be permanently and irrevocably attached to a specific
          digital asset, such as a cryptocurrency or a non-fungible token (NFT).
          Once a soulbound smart contract is attached to an asset, it becomes an
          integral part of that assets identity and cannot be separated from it.
          In other words, transferring or burning a soulbound NFT is not
          possible.
        </p>
        <p className="min-w-[770px] px-20 text-center font-raj text-lg text-black ">
          Our design consists of two smart contracts: an NFT-based soulbound
          smart contract
          <span
            className="mx-1 underline hover:cursor-pointer hover:brightness-75"
            onClick={() => {
              window.open(
                `${inferFlowscanURL()}/account/${
                  flowConfig['0xAnChainSoulboundNFT']
                }`,
                '_blank'
              )
            }}
          >
            here
          </span>
          and a lazy minting contract that allows users to issue soulbound NFTs
          to other users on Flow and claim soulbound NFTs
          <span
            className="ml-1 underline hover:cursor-pointer hover:brightness-75"
            onClick={() => {
              window.open(
                `${inferFlowscanURL()}/account/${
                  flowConfig['0xSoulboundClaimer']
                }`,
                '_blank'
              )
            }}
          >
            here
          </span>
          . To ensure our soulbound contract integrates easily with the Flow
          ecosystem, we based the contract implementation off the existing
          NonFungibleToken standard.
        </p>
        <p className="min-w-[770px] px-20 text-center font-raj text-lg text-black ">
          We also designed the contracts such that soulbound tokens can be
          minted on demand, which helps us avoid storage error issues and allows
          us to more easily handle situations where users may not have a
          collection installed beforehand.
